 TECHNOLOGIES USED: HTML,CSS, & JAVASCRIPT
   
   I learned how to implement Css styling features in my work. I learned how to use Flexboxes and grids. I also was able to play around with the linear-gradient feature. I used animations on button hover to enhance the user experience. This project really helped me understand event handle and event listen.
